## the fundamentals of a good developer

**Step 1 :** *understand the purpose of the software .* 

There is, in fact, a single purpose of all software: To help people.

Developers who cannot conceive the purpose of the software will write bad software .


***


**Step 2 :** *Every programmer is a designer .*

our design should be easy for you and helpful for others .


***



**Step 3 :** *Misunderstanding.*

Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer.


***


**Step 4 :** *Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication .*

Programming is the act of reducing complexity to simplicity.


***


**Step 5 :** *Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.*

Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.


***



**Step 6 :** *Maintenance is one of the most important things in software development.*

All changes require maintenance.


***



**Step 7 :** *Consistency is a big part of simplicity.*

Code that isn’t consistent becomes harder to understand.


***


I**Step 8 :** *How do you make decisions about your software ?*

The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.


***



**Step 9 :** *Solving Problems.*

If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.


***


**Step 10 :** *Perfect is the enemy of good.*

Start small, improve it, then extend .

***


**Step 11 :** *A prediction is simply a forecast that something will happen in the future.*

Being too generic involves a lot of code that isn’t needed. 

***


**Step 12 :** *An assumption is something that you accept as true or suppose to be true , although you have no conclusive proof.*

Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.

***


**Step 13 :** *Stop Reinventing .*

Don’t reinvent the wheel.


***


 **Step 14 :** *Resistance .* 

As a developer, your first reaction to changing requests should be NO . 

***


**Step 15 :** *Resistance .*

As a developer, your first reaction to changing requests should be NO .


***


**Step 16 :** *Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.*

The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read. 


***


**Step 17** *How do you measure your productivity ?*

One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code.


***


**Step 18 :** *When should you add logging and error handling to your project ?*

Untested code is the code that doesn’t work.


***

 

 **Step 19 :** *When should you add logging and error handling to your project ?*

Untested code is the code that doesn’t work.


***



 **Step 20 :** *Running Away From Rewriting .*

Rewriting code is often a developer delusion, not the solution in most cases .


***


 **Step 21 :** *Say what code is doing .*

The real purpose of comments is to explain "WHY" you did something, not "WHAT" the code is doing.


***

 

 **Step 22 :** *Picking Technologies .*

Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can.
 

 ***


 **Step 23 :** *Keep learning .*

Know that every specific problem has its own specific solution.
 

***


 **Step 24 :** *A lot of times it’s better to be a quitter than a hero .*

Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.
 

***


 **Step 25 :** *Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help .*

always seek advice.
